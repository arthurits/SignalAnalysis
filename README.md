## External dependencies
The fractal dimension implementation was based on Carlos Sevcik's ["A procedure to estimate the fractal dimension of waveforms"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5266).

This project uses routines from the following Gits:
* [FftSharp](https://github.com/swharden/FftSharp)
* [ScottPlot](https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot)
